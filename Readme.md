## Project Structure


The project is organized into the following directories and files:

### 1. `dataset/`
This folder contains the datasets required for training and evaluation. It is structured to include subfolders for specific datasets.

- **`cat_dog_images/`**: An example dataset folder that contains images of cats and dogs. This folder can be replaced or extended with other datasets as needed.

---

### 2. `VQ/`
This directory contains the implementation of the **Vector Quantization (VQ)** module.

- **`config.yaml`**: A YAML configuration file that defines the parameters for training and evaluating the VQ model, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- **`vq_model.py`**: The Python script that implements the Vector Quantization model. This file contains the core logic for training and inference using VQ.

---

### 3. `vae/`
This directory contains the implementation of the **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** module.

- **`config.yaml`**: A YAML configuration file that defines the parameters for training and evaluating the VAE model, such as latent dimensions and optimizer settings.
- **`vae_model.py`**: The Python script that implements the Variational Autoencoder. This file includes the architecture and training logic for the VAE.

---

### 4. `ldm/`
This directory contains the implementation of the **Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)** module.

- **`config.yaml`**: A YAML configuration file that defines the parameters for training and evaluating the LDM model, such as diffusion steps and noise levels.
- **`ldm_model.py`**: The Python script that implements the Latent Diffusion Model. This file includes the architecture and training logic for LDM.

---

### 5. `train.py`
This is the main training script for the project. It is designed to handle the training process for all models (VQ, VAE, and LDM) based on the specified configuration file. Users can run this script with a command like:
```bash
python train.py
```
